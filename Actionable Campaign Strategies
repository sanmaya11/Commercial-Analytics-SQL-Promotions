1. 📌 ROI-Based Budget Reallocation
Problem Identified: High spend doesn't always lead to better ROI (e.g., Brazil and USA campaigns).

Strategy:

Allocate greater share of marketing budget to regions and campaign types with ROI > 1 (e.g., CardiMax in Germany and India).

Set a cutoff threshold ROI (e.g., 0.5) below which campaigns must be reviewed or cut.

2. 🧪 A/B Testing for Campaign Formats
Problem Identified: Unclear effectiveness of multiple campaigns with identical sales (e.g., AllerClear Brazil).

Strategy:

Test different promotion types (Ad, Event, Doctor Training, Samples) for the same brand in similar markets.

Measure differential impact using conversion metrics and ROI to identify the most cost-effective approach.

3. 📅 Optimize Campaign Timing
Problem Identified: Monthly spend/sales trends show mismatches (e.g., high spend in May doesn't result in high sales).

Strategy:

Perform a month-over-month ROI analysis to find ideal campaign windows.

Use historical seasonal trends to time campaigns when customer receptiveness is higher.

4. 🩺 Prioritize High-Touch Promotion Types
Problem Identified: Doctor Training and Sample Distribution yield higher ROIs, but are underutilized.

Strategy:

Increase investment in Doctor Training (India, Germany) and Sample Distribution (Brazil, India).

Pair with local influencers/physicians to enhance trust and adoption.

5. 🌍 Geo-Specific Strategy Customization
Problem Identified: Certain regions (like Brazil/USA) have consistent low ROI despite multiple campaigns.

Strategy:

Localize content and channels (language, media format, influencers).

Explore alternate distribution models like online detailing or hybrid events.

Conduct market research before launching a new campaign.

6. 📈 Create Dynamic ROI Dashboards for Monitoring
Problem Identified: Some campaigns continue despite poor ROI.

Strategy:

Build Power BI dashboards with real-time ROI tracking.

Set alerts when ROI falls below a defined threshold.

Enable dynamic filtering by brand, region, promotion type, and time period.

7. 💸 Implement Spend Efficiency Metrics
Problem Identified: No visibility on how efficiently budget is converted to sales.

Strategy:

Define new KPIs like “Sales per ₹1,000 spent”.

Evaluate campaigns not only by absolute ROI, but by cost-to-convert ratio.

8. 🧠 Build a Predictive Recommendation Engine (Advanced)
Strategy:

Use your historical data to create a rule-based or ML model.

Input: Brand, Country, Promotion Type → Output: Predicted ROI.

Helps marketing managers simulate and prioritize future campaigns before spending.
