1. ROI Performance by Brand
CardiMax is the best-performing brand:

Multiple campaigns with positive ROI (up to 3).

Highest sales contribution across all brands (21.17% of total sales).

AllerClear has several campaigns with ROI = 0, especially in Brazil and USA.

ðŸ“Œ Takeaway: CardiMax's campaign planning is effective. Reassess AllerClearâ€™s strategy â€” possibly due to poor targeting or promotion type.



2. Promotion Type Effectiveness
Sample Distribution and Doctor Training show higher and positive ROIs.

Ad Campaigns and Events frequently return 0 ROI.

ðŸ“Œ Takeaway: Consider shifting budget from generic ads/events toward interactive or educational formats like doctor training.



3. Regional Effectiveness
India and Germany:

More campaigns with non-zero or high ROI (up to ROI = 3).

Effective use of Doctor Training and Sample Distribution.

Brazil and USA:

High spend with no ROI in many campaigns, especially for AllerClear and CardiMax.

ðŸ“Œ Takeaway: Reallocate resources from Brazil/USA to India and Germany or customize the promotional approach in underperforming countries.



4. Spending Efficiency
Example: CardiMax in Brazil had one ad campaign with a spend of â‚¹1,777.47 generating ROI = 1, but another campaign with â‚¹9,552.29 spend returned ROI = 0.

ðŸ“Œ Takeaway: High spend â‰  high returns. Monitor marginal ROI â€” how much each extra rupee is really contributing to returns.



5. Sales Saturation and Redundancy
Many campaigns show identical sales figures (e.g., 16767 for AllerClear Brazil) despite varying spend and ROI.

Suggests either:

Redundant campaigns targeting same audience.

Or reporting artefact with aggregated sales.

ðŸ“Œ Takeaway: Clean up targeting to avoid overlap and optimize budget utilization. Improve data granularity to track campaign-specific sales.
